With this plugin, a MODX template variable can be transformed in to a small table/grid. 
The number of columns and the column headers can be set in the plugin configuration.
The number of rows can be modified during editing the MODX document. The table/grid is sortable.

Upload the directory multigrid to assets/plugins and creeate a plugin with the following code 
include(MODX_BASE_PATH.'assets/plugins/multigrid/MultiGrid.plugin.php');
and the event OnDocFormRender.

The plugin configuration can be set with the following line: 
&tvid=TV ID;text; &templ=Template;text; &role=Role;text; &columnNames=Column Names;text; 

'TV ID' is the id of a textarea template variable, which will be transformed into a grid.
'Template' is the id (or several comma separated ids) of a template the plugin is executed in.
'Role' is the id  (or several comma separated ids) of a manager user who can use the plugin.
'Column Names' contains the comma separated column names of the generated table/grid.

If there are serveral grid tvs with different settings, the plugin can be duplicated.

To display the template variable, use the snippet in the package.

The JSON string the grid is converted to starts with [[ and ends with ]] so the MODX parser 
thinks it contains a snippet. The package contains two PHx modifiers to test wether the 
variable is empty or filled.
