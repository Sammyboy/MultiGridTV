With this plugin, a MODX template variable can be transformed in to a small table/grid. 
The number of columns and the column headers can be set in the plugin configuration.
The number of rows can be modified during editing the MODX document. The table/grid is sortable.

Upload the directory multigrid to assets/plugins and creeate a plugin with the following code 
include(MODX_BASE_PATH.'assets/plugins/multigrid/MultiGrid.plugin.php');
and the event OnDocFormRender.

The plugin configuration can be set with the following line:
&pluginPath=Plugin path:;text;assets/plugins/multigrid/

Edit the configuration file "MultiGrid.config.php":
'tv_id' is the id of a textarea template variable, which will be transformed into a grid.
'tpl_ids' is the id (or several comma separated ids) of a template the plugin is executed in.
'role' is the id  (or several comma separated ids) of a manager user who can use the plugin.
'columnNames' contains the comma separated column names of the generated table/grid.

To display the template variable, use the snippet in the package.

The JSON string the grid is converted to starts with [[ and ends with ]] so the MODX parser 
thinks it contains a snippet. The package contains two PHx modifiers to test wether the 
variable is empty or filled.
